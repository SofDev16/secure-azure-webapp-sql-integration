#  Secure Azure Web App + SQL Integration

## ðŸ§  Overview

The solution follows best practices for secure network communication in Azure by:
- Hosting the Web App inside an App Service Environment connected to a VNet.
- Using Private Link to connect to the SQL Database without a public IP.
- Implementing custom DNS resolution to route traffic through private endpoints.
- Enforcing Zero Trust by denying public network access to Azure SQL.

**Components:**
- **Azure App Service** â€“ Hosts the web application (.NET).  
- **Azure SQL Database** â€“ Backend data store, accessible only via Private Endpoint.  
- **Private Endpoint** â€“ Provides secure, private connectivity between the app and database.  
- **Virtual Network (VNet)** â€“ Isolates network traffic between resources.  
- **DNS Zone** â€“ Ensures name resolution for the private endpoint.
