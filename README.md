#  Secure Azure Web App + SQL Integration

This project demonstrates how to securely connect an **Azure Web App (.NET)** to an **Azure SQL Database** using **Private Endpoints**, **Virtual Networks (VNet)**, and **custom DNS**‚Äîeliminating all public exposure.

---

## üß† Overview

The solution follows best practices for secure network communication in Azure by:
- Hosting the Web App inside an **App Service Environment** connected to a **VNet**.
- Using **Private Link** to connect to the SQL Database without a public IP.
- Implementing **custom DNS resolution** to route traffic through private endpoints.
- Enforcing **Zero Trust** by denying public network access to Azure SQL.

**Components:**
- **Azure App Service** ‚Äì Hosts the web application (.NET).  
- **Azure SQL Database** ‚Äì Backend data store, accessible only via Private Endpoint.  
- **Private Endpoint** ‚Äì Provides secure, private connectivity between the app and database.  
- **Virtual Network (VNet)** ‚Äì Isolates network traffic between resources.  
- **DNS Zone** ‚Äì Ensures name resolution for the private endpoint.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Steps

1. Create a resource group and VNet in Azure.  
2. Deploy Azure App Service and Azure SQL Database.  
3. Configure **Private Endpoint** for the SQL Database.  
4. Set up **Private DNS Zone** and link it to the VNet.  
5. Deploy **Bicep template** (optional) for automated IaC setup.  
6. Verify private connectivity via `nslookup` and Azure Portal diagnostics.
